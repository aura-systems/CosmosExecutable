<h1 align="center">Cosmos Executable 🌌</h1>

> Cosmos Executable is a utility for creating and running executable files in a Cosmos operating system, implemented in AuraOS for now. It uses Lua 5.2 for scripting, ZIP for data compression in executables.

## Usage

To develop an executable:

1. Place your Lua source files in the 'source' folder.
2. Use the Cosmos Executable builder to create your CEXE file.

Here's how to create a CEXE file:

```
CosmosExecutableBuilder.exe <source_directory> <output_cexe_file>
```

- `<source_directory>`: Directory containing your Lua source files.
- `<output_cexe_file>`: The output CEXE file name.

For more information on how to run and manage executables within Cosmos, please refer to the [Cosmos Documentation](https://cosmosos.github.io/).
